# Royal Match Card Status

Royal Match Card Status is a tool designed to simplify sharing the status of card collections on Reddit, other social platforms, and in-game chat. Users can easily select whether each card is needed or a duplicate using radio buttons and generate formatted output accordingly. Copy the generated text and paste it wherever you need.

**Note:** Gold cards cannot be shared, so no options are available for them. Owed cards are also not applicable for this purpose and are represented by an N/A option.

## Features

- [in development] Save card status selections and load from an existing file.
- Select card status (needed/duplicate) for each card using intuitive radio buttons.
- Generate formatted output for Reddit and in-game chat formats with a click of a button.
- Copy and paste the generated text directly into Reddit posts or in-game chats.

**Note:** In-game chat has a limit of 500 characters and does not allow paragraphs.

## Usage

1. **Select Packs & Card Status**:
   - Use the radio buttons next to each card to indicate whether it is needed or a duplicate.

2. **Generate Format**:
   - Click the "Generate Reddit Format" or "Generate In-Game Format" button to create the formatted text.

3. **Copy and Paste**:
   - Copy the generated text and paste it into the desired platform (Reddit, in-game chat, etc.).
